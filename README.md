# YouTube Verbatim Chrome Extension
Search subtitles inside a YouTube video.

Description
-----------
YouTube Verbatim provides a search box for subtitles thus making possible to
find words or sentences inside a video. Just enable the subtitles and a search
box will appear just below the video. Choose a result to seek the video at a
given position. Note that not all YouTube videos do have the subtitles.

Status
------
Early stage, little tested and with a bounce of corner cases which have yet to
be addressed. Most of the work has been done so I think the 0.1 release would
be ready soon. Feel free to contribute.
